Your goal is to minimize total weighted reindeer weariness:
Weighted Reindeer Weariness = (distance traveled) * (weights carried for that segment)

All sleighs start from north pole (Lat=90, Long=0),

Sleighs have a base weight = 10

Each sleigh has a weight limit = 1000 (excluding the sleigh base weight)
